Eventually this directory could be moved to a separate repository and referenced by version (i.e. tag or commit hash). 

For now, we use this organisation to separate versions of whole Arvados clusters (together with all of their dependent modules). 

If you wish to make a new version of an Arvados cluster, please copy to a new version subdirectory (e.g. `cp -r v3 v4`).
